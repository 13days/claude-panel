# ⌘ Claude Panel

**See exactly what Claude Code sends the model — and everything else in your `~/.claude`.**

A beautiful, zero-dependency local dashboard for Claude Code: browse and edit your slash commands / skills / agents / plugins / workflows, search and replay past sessions, track token spend — and, uniquely, **capture the real system prompt, tool definitions, and every LLM round-trip** behind each conversation.

```bash
npx claude-code-panel
```

## Why

Claude Code scatters everything across `~/.claude` — commands here, skills there, plugins in a JSON manifest, usage buried in hundreds of MB of transcript JSONL. And the most interesting thing of all — *what actually gets sent to the model* — isn't saved anywhere. Claude Panel fixes both:

- **Find** any command / skill / plugin / past session without digging through the CLI — one searchable place, editable in the browser.
- **Recover** the session you lost after a crash or reboot: full-text search your history, one-click `claude --resume`.
- **Understand** how a reply was produced: the exact **system prompt**, **tool definitions**, **full context**, and the **input/output of every LLM round** a query triggered.

## The killer feature: see every LLM round-trip

Claude Code transcripts don't store the system prompt or the raw request/response. Claude Panel runs a tiny **local reverse proxy** that Claude Code talks through, records each API call, and folds it back into the session replay — matched to the exact turn.

Open a session, expand a query, and you get **"🔁 This query triggered N LLM rounds"**. Expand any round to see its **full context sent to the model** (every message, tool call, and tool result), the **system prompt**, the **tool definitions with full descriptions**, the **thinking**, and the **response** — plus token usage.

Set it up once — the panel wires a smart `claude` wrapper into your shell automatically on first run (routes through the proxy when the panel is up, connects directly when it's off, never breaks). API keys are never recorded; everything stays on `127.0.0.1`.

## Features

| Section | What you get |
|---|---|
| **/ Commands** | Your commands + plugin-provided + Claude Code built-ins in one searchable list, with usage counts. Full CRUD on yours; built-ins read-only |
| **Skills / Agents / Workflows** | Browse & edit, frontmatter as chips, Markdown rendered. Marketplace-installed items detected and protected from accidental edits |
| **Plugins** | Installed plugins with version, marketplace, and everything they provide; one-click uninstall |
| **Config** | `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, keybindings edited in place (JSON validated before save); plus a merged CLAUDE.md view |
| **Sessions** | Every session that still has a transcript — full-text search across all of them, chat-style **replay**, and one-click `claude --resume` |
| **🕵️ Inspector** | Local reverse proxy capturing live traffic: system prompt, tool defs, full context, streamed response incl. thinking, Claude Code version. Persisted to disk, folded into replays |
| **Stats** | `ccusage`-accurate usage: daily messages, per-model tokens, 24h heatline, `ccusage daily`-style cost table, and a live ticker (today's spend, burn rate, budget alerts) |
| **🎁 Wrapped** | One-click shareable PNG stats card with spend, tokens, top command, favorite model and an earned badge |

Cross-cutting:

- 🌏 **Full i18n** — 中文 / English / 日本語, switchable live (UI + backend + generated content).
- 📁 **Project scope** — a dropdown scopes Commands/Skills/Agents/Workflows/Config to any project's `.claude/` directory.
- 🎯 **Accurate stats** — recursive transcript scan, `message.id + requestId` dedup, streaming-final handling, 5m/1h cache-tier pricing. Validated day-by-day against ccusage.
- 🔒 **Local only** — binds to `127.0.0.1`, path-traversal guarded, API keys never recorded.
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — two files, no build step, ~0.8s cold scan of 300MB transcripts (~13ms warm).

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js ≥ 18.

```bash
npx claude-code-panel
# open http://localhost:4321
```

On first run it wires a `claude` wrapper into your shells so future sessions are captured automatically. **Open a new terminal** (or `source ~/.zshrc`) and use `claude` as usual — with the panel running, that session's full trace shows up under Sessions. Opt out with `CCP_NO_PROXY_SETUP=1`; remove with `npx claude-code-panel uninstall-proxy`.

From source (no `npm install` needed — zero dependencies):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/13days/claude-panel.git
cd claude-panel && node server.js
```

Environment variables: `PORT` (default `4321`), `PROXY_PORT` (default `PORT+1`), `CLAUDE_DIR` (default `~/.claude`), `CCP_NO_PROXY_SETUP=1` to skip shell setup.

### Terminal statusline

Show today's spend at the bottom of your Claude Code terminal — in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "curl -s http://localhost:4321/api/statusline" } }
```

→ `$23.40 today · 40.6M tok · fable-5`

### Try it with demo data

```bash
python3 scripts/gen-demo-data.py
CLAUDE_DIR="$PWD/demo-data/claude" PORT=4999 node server.js
```

**Inspector** — the real system prompt, tool definitions and response Claude Code never saves:

## How it works

Two files, no framework, no build step:

- **`server.js`** — dependency-free Node HTTP server: a REST API over `CLAUDE_DIR` (guarded writes), a transcript-based usage aggregator with an mtime-keyed cache, and a reverse proxy on `PROXY_PORT` that records each `/v1/messages` round-trip (decompressing gzip/br), keyed by response message id.
- **`index.html`** — single-page UI with its own tiny Markdown renderer and CSS charts.

### Adding a language

1. Register it in `LANGS` (`index.html`) — shows in the dropdown.
2. Add a dictionary to `I18N` (`index.html`) and `STRINGS` (`server.js`).

Partial translations are fine — missing keys fall back `your language → English → default`.

## Caveats

- Costs are estimates from official per-model pricing (validated against ccusage; your billing may differ).
- Transcripts are kept ~30 days by Claude Code; the system prompt / LLM trace only exists for sessions captured live via the proxy — historical ones can't be recovered.
- The built-in command list is a static snapshot (PRs welcome).
